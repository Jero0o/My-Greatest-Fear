### Introduction

Hello my name is Jesse James. I am currently in grade 11 trying to pursue computer science.
I am new to coding and will do my best to learn the ways of programming. I made this markdown last year and came back to edit it and talk about my greatest fear of **heights**.

### My reasons for being afraid

<ul>
  <li>I get nervous easily and my heart will start beating fast </li>
  <li>Climbing certain heights makes my body unresponsive and shaky </li>
  <li>Just looking down from above is just a really intimidating thing to do.</li>
  <li>I lose confidence real quick. My feet must stay in the ground.</li>
  <li>I start to become aware of my surroundings and be more careful. One mistake I will fall can't risk that.</li>
</ul>

### Accurate description of me when I'm on high places

Another thing about me is that I find falling to the ground looks relaxing or cool to do for some reason which contradicts with my greatest fear
Gotta overcome my fears I guess...
